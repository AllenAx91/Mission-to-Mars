# Mission-to-Mars :rocket:

This repo includes a web-app that employs the use of BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres. The scrapped data is then stored on a Mongo database and then transferred to a web application to display the data. Bootstrap 3 components are used to style the webpage.
